# RTMButils

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RTMButils is to have a bunch of stock assessment functions for RTMB models in one place.
Note that these won't necessarily work for complex RTMB model structures aka [SPoRC](https://github.com/chengmatt/SPoRC).
Currently this is setup to work with GOA Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish. 
That is, the names in the [models](https://github.com/afsc-assessments/goa_pop/blob/main/2025/R/models.R) must align with the function names herein. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of RTMButils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("BenWilliams-NOAA/RTMButils")
```
